# Dots-Boxes-Game
UofT ECE243 Project 

1.0 Introduction
Dots and Boxes is a two player game inspired by the pencil and paper version where the goal is to connect the dots and complete more boxes than your opponent. 

2.0 How to Play
From the homescreen, the player has the option to play in 2 modes: level 1 and level 2. To start level 1, you press KEY0 and to start level 2 you press KEY1. The first player will choose which 2 dots they want to connect by using the switches. Selecting switch 0 and any other switch (switch 1 - switch 9), will draw a horizontal line between 2 dots. Selecting switch 1 and any other switch (switch 2 - switch 9) will draw a vertical line between 2 dots.

Users will take turns connecting dots, the player who completes a box will get the point and the score is kept at the bottom of the screen for each player. When all boxes are filled the game will go to the corresponding finishing screen based on if player 1 won, player 2 won or if it's a tie. 

At this point pressing KEY2 will return the user to the starting screen. Level 2 has a slight modification where some boxes are randomized to “blow up” demonstrated by an exploding animation, hence the user that fills up that box will not get the point. 

The sound effects indicate different player movement such as a unique sound effect for when the line is placed on an empty space or if the player attempts to place the line on a taken space. In addition, the sound indicates when a box is formed or enclosing a box marked as a hidden trap by an exploding sound effect.
